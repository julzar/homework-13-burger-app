## Description

Eat-Da-Burger is a browser game where the player can "cook" a burger, and then devour it. Cooked burgers appear in a list on the left side of the screen with a "devour it" button next to them. When the button is clicked, the burger is "devoured" and moves to a list on the right side. That's the whole game.
